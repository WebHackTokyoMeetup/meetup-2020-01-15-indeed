# Contributing to WebHack

Thanks for being willing to contributing to WebHack!

The following is a set of guidelines - rather than rules - for contributing to WebHack. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## What should I have?

You must have **kindness** to other organizers, speakers, sponsors and attendees. 

You must have **commitment** to getting things done. 

## What should I expect?

Feel free to email to contact.webhack@gmail.com with a brief self-introduction and the initiative to contribute. We will reach out and you will experience the following things.

### The welcome 1:1

You will have a mentor. The mentor will schedule a 30-min in-person or online meeting.

In the meeting, your mentor will explain:

1.  WebHack's values and products
2. Members and functions
3. Meeting types and cadences

Your mentor will ask:

1. Your values and motivators
2. Your preferred work style and interested contribution areas

### The follow-up 1:1

If you believe contributing to WebHack is reciprocal to you and WebHack, tell your mentor, then your mentor will schedule another 30-min meeting to:

1. Explain the logistics of iterating products
2. Propose a well-defined and bite-sized task

Feel free to argue or push back if the proposed task is unclear or improper. It would be even better if you could propose a task based on the understanding of the logistics.   

### First hands-on task

So far, you and your mentor have reached an agreement on your first task! Use the following guidelinces:

* Feel free to ask your mentor questions 
* **Honestly**, **proactively** and **timely** tell your mentor if your delivery would be delayed or incomplete or undone

### Organizer meetings

Congratulations! You have successfully finished the first task! 

To gain the big picture, you can join the organizer meetings. There are two types of meetings - post-event retrospectives and monthly sync-ups. It's encouraged to join each type at least once. On those meetings, you will 

1. Do a brief self-introduction on the first meeting you join
2. Observe how other organizers discuss in-progress products. 

Feel free to speak up and share your thoughts on the meetings.  

### The feedback 1:1

Now you have closely observed how WebHack organizers work. Your mentor will schedule a 30-min meeting to understand:

1. What fits you?
2. What doesn't fit you?
3. How much would you like to continue contributing?
4. Any suggestions or comments

### Advancement

"*Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.*" -- Winston Churchill

If you and WebHack organizers believe it's reciprocal, you will become an organizer and make a significant influence on the WebHack community!
