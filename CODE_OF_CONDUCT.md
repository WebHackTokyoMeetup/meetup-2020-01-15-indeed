# Code of Conduct

All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our meetup are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating an open, kind and inclusive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

We do not tolerate harassment of meetup participants in any form for any venue. 

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, unwelcome sexual attention, and **sustained disruption of talks or other events**. 

Meetup participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the meetup *without a refund* at the discretion of the meetup organisers.

## Our Responsibilities

Meetup organisers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Meetup organisers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
