# What we value

We value **continuous learning** and **relationship building**. We believe we are what we learn. We believe connecting to people helps us know ourselves and achieve what we couldn't do alone. 

# Who we are

We are **voluntary** organizers who want to utilize our skills and go beyond our roles to support others and ultimately make an impact on the IT industry as a whole.

# What we do 

We organize and facilitate two-hour-long meet-ups that contain presentations by engineers and engineering managers on various topics and Q&A for further discussions, as well as networking for future connections.

# Who we are for

The meet-ups are designed for any engineer or engineering manager who wishes to further their career development, learn from industrial experts, and connect with people across the entire IT industry.
